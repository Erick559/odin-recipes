# Odin Recipes

## Description: This is a simple HTML webpage that i made to familiarize myself with topics that I learnt from the Odin project's web development course

### Purpose

- Create a simple HTML page using concepts learnt from the Odin project course. The concepts practiced are;

  - **Links:** Both relative and absolute. This is achieved by using the anchor tag 
  
    `<a href="destination link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is the destination link</a>` 

    The href attribute is used to reference the destination link. The target attribute is used to set whether the destination link should be opened on another tab or the same tab. Finally, the rel attribute is used to ensure the the destination link does not show the origin link, this is a security measure to prevent tabnabbing.

  - **Adding images:** This is achieved by using the image tag.

     `<img src="image.png alt="image.png"/>`

    The src attribute is used to reference the images location. The alt attribute on the other hand is used to add text to the image in case it does not load or as a feature to help the visually impaired.
  
  - **Lists:** This shows the use of two types of lists namely **Unordered lists** and **Ordered Lists**. This elements are achieve by using the `<ul></ul>` for unordered lists and `<ol></ol>` for ordered lists. With the `<li></li>` tags containing the contents of the list.
  
  - **Git and GitHub:** This will help me in familiarizing with the workflows and best practices for creatinga and maintaining GitHub repositories. Best practices such as crafting a good commit message and knowing when to commit changes.
